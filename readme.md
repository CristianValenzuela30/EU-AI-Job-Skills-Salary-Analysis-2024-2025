## 📊 Project Overview
This project analyzes **15,000+ real AI & Data job postings** (2024–2025) across Europe to reveal **exactly which skills pay the most** and **how much you should realistically earn** in roles like:

- Data Scientist  
- Machine Learning Engineer  
- AI Research Scientist  
- Data Engineer  
- NLP / Computer Vision Engineer  
- AI Product Manager  
- MLOps & Robotics Engineer  

Data sourced from **LinkedIn, Indeed, Glassdoor, and Kaggle**.

## 🎯 Key Questions Answered
- Which skill combinations (e.g., PyTorch + Kubernetes + AWS) give the biggest salary boost?  
- What’s the real market rate for your role + experience level in Germany, Switzerland, France, Netherlands, etc.?  
- How much do location, company size, and remote ratio actually affect compensation?

## 🛠️ Skills Demonstrated (Full End-to-End Workflow)
- Advanced **data cleaning** on a very messy real-world dataset (missing values, inconsistent formats, mixed currencies)  
- Smart **imputation** using group-level statistics (job title + location)  
- **Feature engineering**: created `experience_level`, `salary_eur`, exploded skills into long format  
- **Python (Pandas + NumPy)** for ETL and transformation  
- **Interactive visualization** with Tableau Public  
- Salary benchmarking & realistic range estimation
